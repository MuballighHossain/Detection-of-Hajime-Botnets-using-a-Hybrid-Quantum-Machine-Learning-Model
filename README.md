# Detection-of-Hajime-Botnets-using-a-Hybrid-Quantum-Machine-Learning-Model
Botnets are harmful software or malware that infects computers in various ways. Cyber thieves
employ specific Trojan horses to breach the security of multiple users' computers and take
control of a collection of infected workstations. These botnets are capable of committing a wide
range of cybercrimes, including DDoS assaults, virus distribution, online fraud, and large-scale
spam or phishing operations. Botnets have evolved from attacking PCs to vulnerable IoT
devices. Botnets like Mirai have generated large DDos attacks on well-known companies and
devices and caused a lot of damage. So, it is very important to study these new botnets like
Hajime and Mirai to prevent future attacks.
This research aims to develop an advanced detection algorithm based on a hybrid quantum machine learning model. This model takes the classical machine learning model and adds a quantum layer to it, ensuring better performance overall.
